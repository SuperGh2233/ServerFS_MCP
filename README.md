# ServerFS MCP

> ServerFS MCP is a secure MCP server that exposes explicitly configured Linux directories as controlled workdirs to AI agents, **read-only by default** with opt-in per-workdir file mutation.

Agents reach your directories through the **OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel**. They can list, find, search, read and stat files anywhere you mount; optionally transfer bounded whole binary files; and, in workdirs you explicitly mark read-write, create, edit, delete or revision-guarded replace files through narrow tools. Nothing else: no shell, no command execution, no unguarded overwrite, no recursive delete, no escape from the directories you configure.

## Architecture

```text
Linux filesystem
   → Docker bind mounts (/workdirs/01..16)
        read-only by default
        read-write only where WORKDIR_XX_READ_ONLY=false
   → ServerFS MCP (streamable-http on :8000, internal network only)
        read tools:  list / find / search / read / stat
        mutation tools: create / edit / delete (read-write workdirs only)
        optional binary path: download / upload / revision-guarded replace
        optional ChatGPT file ingress → isolated sidecar → temporary HTTPS file URL
        optional Agent path: nine Agent tools → host Agent Bridge → Codex/Claude
          optional experimental Jev advisor → preflight + runtime routing + approval advice
   → OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel (official tunnel-client container, outbound-only)
   → ChatGPT
```

The MCP server container has **no Internet egress** and no published ports. The tunnel reaches it over a Docker-internal network. v0.5.0 adds an optional, separately isolated `serverfs-file-ingress` sidecar for ChatGPT file parameters; only that sidecar receives file-download egress, it has no workdir mounts or OpenAI credentials, and the main MCP container remains internal-only. The container root filesystem stays read-only regardless of any workdir setting.

The default `compose.yml` exposes the original 11 filesystem tools. Binary transfer is opt-in: when at least one workdir enables it, `download_binary_file` and `upload_binary_file` are added, producing a 13-tool filesystem surface. When the administrator also configures Agent policy and uses `compose.agent.yml`, the overlay adds nine structured Agent tools. The four supported surfaces are therefore 11 / 13 / 20 / 22 tools for filesystem-only / filesystem+binary / filesystem+Agent / filesystem+binary+Agent. Agent tools broker structured tasks through the host-side Bridge; they are not a shell, argv, or generic command executor. Delegated tasks should therefore stay objective-level and capability-bounded: one authorized goal, explicit mutation scope/stop conditions, and only the context/evidence needed for that goal. This improves clarity and reduces accidental ambiguity; it is not intended to bypass provider safety checks.

`main` includes an optional **advisory-only** Jev task advisor inside the host Agent Bridge. It does not add an MCP tool, runtime, permission, or safety authority. When `SERVERFS_JEV_API_KEY` is empty or absent, no Jev client is constructed and task submission follows the existing path unchanged. When configured, one pinned `jev-1.13.0` task-submission request evaluates task atomicity, mutation scope, stop conditions, verification evidence, execution fit, and a four-way route recommendation: `direct_serverfs_tool`, `codex`, `claude`, or `human_review`. If a native provider later creates an approval request, the same Jev client may make one additional approval-specific request that scores necessity, scope, destructive/irreversible risk, sensitive access and external side effects, then returns an advisory recommendation; identical approvals within the same task reuse task-local advice instead of calling Jev again. Ordinary turns and question prompts do not create that extra request. No Jev result blocks, rewrites, reroutes, approves, denies, or expands a task; the explicit runtime and approval contracts remain authoritative. The feature was introduced in v0.6.0 as an opt-in experimental capability. See the public [Jev Advisors guide](https://ntlx.github.io/ServerFS_MCP/docs/jev-advisors/) plus the repository [Preflight note](docs/jev-agent-preflight-experiment.md), [Runtime Router note](docs/jev-runtime-router-experiment.md), and [Approval Advisor note](docs/jev-approval-advisor-experiment.md).

v0.7.0 strengthens the existing Agent Bridge without turning ServerFS into a workflow engine. Every new task freezes an immutable execution manifest and optional opaque `correlation_id`; normalized events use schema-versioned envelopes; tasks receive a 24-hour deadline and terminal state is retained for seven days by default. Workspace-write runs add a persistent active-slot recovery guard on top of the existing `flock`, so an abnormal Bridge exit fails closed with `WORKDIR_RECOVERY_REQUIRED` until provider state is reconciled. Final responses up to 256 KiB remain inline; responses above 256 KiB and up to 8 MiB are atomically spooled in private Bridge state and can be reconstructed exactly through the read-only `read_agent_task_result` tool. Results above 8 MiB still fail with `AGENT_RESULT_TOO_LARGE`.

## Prerequisites

- Linux server
- Docker + Docker Compose
- An OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel (created in the OpenAI dashboard)

## macOS native Agent Bridge

Docker Desktop runs the Linux ServerFS image inside a VM. Its macOS file-sharing
layer cannot pass a host Unix-domain socket into that container, which the
Phase E Agent Bridge uses for same-user peer authentication. For Agent Bridge
testing on macOS, run ServerFS and the Agent Bridge as native processes under
the same login user; Docker runs only the outbound OpenAI tunnel. ServerFS
binds to `127.0.0.1:8000`, and the tunnel reaches that loopback endpoint via
`host.docker.internal`. The MCP transport accepts that exact Host value and
still rejects non-empty Origins.

Set `SERVERFS_NATIVE_MODE=true` in the existing `.env`. In this mode,
`WORKDIR_XX_PATH` values are direct absolute macOS paths and must be real
directories. Agent Bridge peer credentials are checked with macOS
`getpeereid(2)` for every local socket connection. The native ServerFS launcher
loads only ServerFS/workdir settings from `.env`; tunnel credentials and
provider-only settings are not copied into its process environment.

Use dedicated scratch space for a workspace-write Agent workdir. Keep broader
project workdirs read-only or Agent-disabled. The Mac host processes run with
the login user's normal filesystem permissions, so Agent delegation should be
enabled only for workdirs you explicitly authorize.

Install the locked Python environments and render the Bridge config using the
same `.env`:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install uv
.venv/bin/uv sync --frozen
python3.12 -m venv agent_bridge/.venv
agent_bridge/.venv/bin/python -m pip install uv
agent_bridge/.venv/bin/uv sync --frozen
```

Create the user-owned socket, lock, state, and Codex test-home directories from
the values in `.env`, then render the private Bridge config:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/serverfs-agent-bridge" \
  "$HOME/.local/share/serverfs-agent-bridge/runtime/socket" \
  "$HOME/.local/share/serverfs-agent-bridge/runtime/locks" \
  "$HOME/.local/state/serverfs-agent-bridge"
python3 deployment/agent-bridge/render_config.py \
  --env-file .env \
  --output "$HOME/.config/serverfs-agent-bridge/config.json"
```

Then run the Bridge and ServerFS in separate terminals:

```bash
deployment/agent-bridge/run_macos_bridge.sh \
  "$HOME/.config/serverfs-agent-bridge/config.json"
.venv/bin/python deployment/agent-bridge/run_macos_server.py --env-file .env
docker compose --project-name serverfs-mac --env-file .env \
  -f compose.macos.yml up -d
```

The macOS tunnel-only Compose file reuses the existing Tunnel ID and Runtime
API Key. Stop any other tunnel client using that Tunnel ID before starting it.
The base Linux Compose deployment and its `compose.agent.yml` overlay remain
unchanged.

For Codex, use a dedicated short `SERVERFS_CODEX_HOME` such as
`$HOME/.codex/serverfs-mac-test`, with `model = "gpt-6-luna"` and
`model_reasoning_effort = "max"` in its `config.toml`. Keep the path short
because Codex nests its control socket below the home and macOS limits
Unix-socket path length; this keeps model settings and authentication separate
from the regular Codex home.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd serverfs-mcp
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env:
#  1. set WORKDIR_XX_ALIAS / WORKDIR_XX_PATH for each directory to expose
#  2. fill CONTROL_PLANE_TUNNEL_ID and CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY

chmod 600 .env          # the file contains a runtime API key
docker compose pull     # fetch the published image from GHCR
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps       # serverfs-mcp should become (healthy)
docker compose logs -f openai-tunnel
```

The default Quick Start remains the base 11-tool deployment. For the optional
Agent deployment, see [the Phase E guide](deployment/agent-bridge/README.md)
and [compose.agent.yml](compose.agent.yml); it is an explicit overlay.

Building from source instead of pulling — build under a scratch tag, never under the tag a production `.env` pins:

```bash
SERVERFS_IMAGE=serverfs-mcp:dev docker compose build
SERVERFS_IMAGE=serverfs-mcp:dev docker compose up -d
```

A bare `docker compose build` writes to whatever `SERVERFS_IMAGE` names, so with a pinned production `.env` it would silently repoint that release tag at local code. Upgrading a pinned deployment pulls the published image instead; see [Upgrade](#upgrade).

## Docker Image & Release Channels

Images are published to GitHub Container Registry by GitHub Actions:

| Channel | Tag | Updated by |
|---|---|---|
| Stable | `ghcr.io/ntlx/serverfs_mcp:latest` | newest `vX.Y.Z` tag |
| Pinned release | `ghcr.io/ntlx/serverfs_mcp:0.7.0` | `v0.7.0` |
| Pinned minor | `ghcr.io/ntlx/serverfs_mcp:0.7` | newest `v0.7.x` tag |
| Development | `ghcr.io/ntlx/serverfs_mcp:edge` | every push to `main` |

Every image is multi-arch: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

Release automation — the image version comes from the **Git tag**, never from a GitHub Release event:

```text
push to main   →  edge
tag vX.Y.Z     →  X.Y.Z  +  X.Y  +  latest
```

The v0.7.0 release line publishes `0.7.0`, `0.7` and `latest` from the immutable `v0.7.0` tag. `latest` always points at the newest published stable release; pushes to `main` update only `edge`.

## Workdir Configuration

Up to 16 slots. Each slot maps a host directory to an alias the agent sees:

```env
WORKDIR_01_ALIAS=projects
WORKDIR_01_PATH=/srv/projects
WORKDIR_01_DESCRIPTION="Projects"
WORKDIR_01_READ_ONLY=true          # read-only (default)

WORKDIR_02_ALIAS=scratch
WORKDIR_02_PATH=/srv/scratch
WORKDIR_02_DESCRIPTION="Agent scratch space"
WORKDIR_02_READ_ONLY=false         # read-write: the agent may modify files here
```

Rules:

- `ALIAS`: starts with a letter, then letters/digits/`_`/`-`, max 32 chars, unique, case-sensitive. Startup fails on duplicates.
- `PATH`: must already exist — Docker is configured with `create_host_path: false`, so a typo fails loudly instead of silently creating an empty directory.
- `READ_ONLY`: `true` (default) or `false`. Write it as `true`/`false` — the value feeds both ServerFS's own authorization and the Docker bind mount flag, and Docker Compose rejects `1`/`0` for the latter. Any unrecognised value stops the container at startup (`CONFIGURATION_ERROR`) instead of guessing. **A typo can never grant write access.**
- Leave both `ALIAS` and `PATH` empty to disable a slot.
- Host paths are never sent to the MCP container (only aliases are); the mapping exists only in Docker bind mounts.

### Global defaults and workdir overrides

v0.4 resolves one immutable effective policy for every enabled workdir at startup. Global `SERVERFS_*` values are defaults; an explicit `WORKDIR_XX_*` scalar override wins for that slot, while an empty workdir value inherits the global default. This applies to hidden-file policy, read/write limits, binary transfer, and Agent policy. `EXTRA_DENY_GLOBS` is intentionally stricter: global and workdir deny globs are **unioned**, so a workdir can add restrictions but cannot remove the global deny floor.

Binary transfer is disabled by default. Enable it globally with `SERVERFS_BINARY_TRANSFER_ENABLED=true` or for one slot with `WORKDIR_XX_BINARY_TRANSFER_ENABLED=true`. `SERVERFS_MAX_BINARY_TRANSFER_BYTES` / `WORKDIR_XX_MAX_BINARY_TRANSFER_BYTES` bound both upload and download; the default is 8 MiB. Enabling binary transfer does not release write authorization: uploads still require `WORKDIR_XX_READ_ONLY=false`.

v0.5.0 optionally accepts a ChatGPT/OpenAI file parameter as the upload source. This path is separately disabled by default. To enable it, set `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ENABLED=true` and start Compose with `--profile file-ingress`. The sidecar requires a narrow host policy: exact hosts may be listed in `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS`; for real ChatGPT fileParams, set `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ALLOW_OPENAI_BLOB_HOSTS=true` to admit only the measured `oaisdmntpr<Azure-storage-account-suffix>.blob.core.windows.net` family. Generic `*.blob.core.windows.net` wildcards remain unsupported. `upload_binary_file` then advertises `_meta["openai/fileParams"] = ["file"]` and accepts exactly one of `data_base64` or `file`. The client-supplied `file_name`, `file_id` and temporary URL never select the ServerFS destination; the explicit `path` argument remains authoritative.

Agent policy follows the same inheritance model via `SERVERFS_AGENT_MODE` / `SERVERFS_AGENT_RUNTIMES` and the workdir overrides. `SERVERFS_AGENT_BRIDGE_ENABLED` remains the separate infrastructure master gate.

### Read-only by default, and after upgrades

`WORKDIR_XX_READ_ONLY` is **absent** from every v0.1 configuration. Upgrading to v0.2 therefore leaves all existing workdirs read-only: nothing becomes writable until you write `false` yourself. The startup log records how many workdirs are writable.

The variable controls two independent layers from one place:

| Layer | Effect |
|---|---|
| ServerFS authorization | A read-only workdir refuses every mutation with `WORKDIR_READ_ONLY`, even if the mount is writable |
| Docker bind mount | `read_only: true` on `/workdirs/XX` — the kernel refuses writes even if the application were compromised |

Both layers must be released for a mutation to reach the disk.

### What the agent sees

Agents address files as `workdir + relative path` (`{"workdir": "projects", "path": "PandaWiki/docker-compose.yml"}`) and call `list_workdirs` first to learn each workdir's `access` (`read-only` or `read-write`). Host paths like `/srv/projects` are never exposed in tool results, error messages, or logs.

## Linux Permissions

The container runs as UID/GID `10001` by default (`SERVERFS_UID` / `SERVERFS_GID`).

**Docker's `read_only` bind mount does not bypass Linux file permissions.** The UID must be able to *read* the host directories. If a directory is not readable, you get `Permission denied` — that is correct behavior, not a bug. Do not `chmod 777` or `chown` host trees to work around it; instead grant read access to the specific UID/GID (e.g. via a group).

A **read-write** workdir needs more:

- write permission on the directory itself (create, edit, delete all need it), plus the execute bit to traverse it;
- for editing, the UID must own the file or be able to replace it — ServerFS preserves the original mode, ownership and extended attributes, and **refuses the edit** (`METADATA_PRESERVATION_FAILED`) rather than silently changing an owner it cannot reproduce. Files owned by another user are therefore not editable by a non-root container.

Point the read-write workdir at a directory whose owner/group model already matches the ServerFS UID/GID — typically `chown -R 10001:10001` on a dedicated scratch directory, or a group the container is a member of. Never `chmod -R 777`.

> Never mount the host filesystem root, Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`), SSH directories, credential stores, or other broad sensitive locations as a workdir.

## OpenAI Tunnel Setup

1. Create a tunnel in the OpenAI dashboard; note its **Tunnel ID**.
2. Create a **Runtime API Key** with `Tunnels Read` + `Tunnels Use` permissions (not an Admin Key — Admin Keys are only for tunnel CRUD, and this project never needs one).
3. Fill in `.env`:

```env
CONTROL_PLANE_TUNNEL_ID=tunnel_...
CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=rtk_...
```

The tunnel is **outbound-only**: no public domain, no TLS certificate, no inbound firewall rule, no reverse proxy. The container connects out to OpenAI's control plane and forwards MCP traffic to `http://serverfs-mcp:8000/mcp` over the internal Docker network.

To troubleshoot the tunnel, use the official client's own diagnostics (`tunnel-client doctor`, `/readyz`) rather than guessing.

## Security Model

Defense in depth — each layer is independent:

| Layer | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Read-only by default | Six read tools work everywhere. Five mutation tools exist but refuse to act in any workdir that is not explicitly configured read-write — a write capability that has to be turned on per workdir, never a global switch. There is still no shell, no command execution and no generic `write_file`. |
| Per-workdir mutation opt-in | `WORKDIR_XX_READ_ONLY` (default `true`) drives both the ServerFS authorization check and the Docker bind mount. Application authorization is checked *first* and independently: a read-only workdir answers `WORKDIR_READ_ONLY` even if the mount is writable. |
| Create ≠ edit | `create_text_file` never overwrites (it fails with `PATH_ALREADY_EXISTS` on any existing file, directory or symlink) and `edit_text_file` never creates (a mistyped path fails with `PATH_NOT_FOUND` instead of silently becoming a new file). Both file and directory operations are separate tools — no `type: "file" \| "directory"` switch. |
| Optimistic concurrency | `read_text_file` and `stat_file` return an opaque `revision` (`v1:…`, a digest of the object's stat tuple — never a raw inode/UID/GID). `edit_text_file`, `delete_file` and `delete_directory` require the caller's `expected_revision` and fail with `REVISION_CONFLICT` if the object changed. |
| Mutation serialization | All mutations run under one process-wide lock, so two callers holding the same revision cannot both commit; exactly one wins and the other gets `REVISION_CONFLICT`. Reads never take the lock. |
| Exact-match edits | Edits replace literal text (never regex, never fuzzy), must match `expected_count` occurrences exactly, and apply in order as an all-or-nothing transaction. No edit touches the disk until every edit has been validated. |
| Atomic publication | `create_text_file` writes a reserved same-directory temp file and publishes it with `linkat(2)`, which cannot overwrite. `edit_text_file` writes a temp file and publishes with `renameat(2)`. A concurrent reader sees either the complete old or the complete new content — never a partial file, and never a truncated-then-rewritten file. |
| Metadata preservation | Editing replaces an inode, so ServerFS copies ownership, mode and extended attributes onto the replacement *before* the rename — in that order, because `chown(2)` clears setuid/setgid bits and can disturb `security.*` metadata — and fails with `METADATA_PRESERVATION_FAILED` if any of them cannot be reproduced. A file with multiple hard links is refused outright (`MULTIPLE_HARDLINKS_NOT_SUPPORTED` rather than silently splitting the link). |
| No recursive delete, no unguarded force | `delete_directory` removes an empty directory only; anything inside it — hidden, denied or a leftover temp file — yields `DIRECTORY_NOT_EMPTY` and the interior is never named in the error. `create_directory` is not recursive. There is no `force` or `recursive` mode. The only overwrite path is `upload_binary_file(overwrite=true)`, and it requires the caller's `expected_revision` for one existing regular file. |
| Workdir root is immutable | The workdir root itself can never be created, edited or deleted (`ROOT_MUTATION_NOT_ALLOWED`). |
| Reserved names | Two internal names are hard-reserved: `.serverfs-tmp-*` (atomic-publication temp files) and `.serverfs-disabled` (the workdir registry's disabled-slot marker, which startup reads — an agent able to create it would break the next start). Neither is listable, findable, searchable, readable, stat-able or mutable, in every configuration: `SERVERFS_ALLOW_HIDDEN` and `SERVERFS_DISABLE_DEFAULT_DENY` do not release them, and ripgrep is told to skip those names outright. |
| Tool annotations | Read tools advertise `readOnlyHint=true`; mutation tools advertise `read_only=false`; `create_*` are non-destructive while `edit`/`delete_*` are destructive. `create_directory`, `edit_text_file` and `delete_*` advertise `idempotentHint=true`; `create_text_file` deliberately advertises `idempotentHint=false` because a failed repeat still creates and cleans up a same-directory temp entry, which can change parent-directory metadata/revision even though the target file is unchanged. All tools advertise `openWorldHint=false`. (Hints, not a security mechanism.) |
| Path resolution | Every path is normalized and confined to the workdir root. `..`, absolute paths, NUL bytes rejected. |
| FD-based traversal | All filesystem access — reads *and* mutations — walks components with `openat(2)` + `O_NOFOLLOW` on directory file descriptors, and mutations act on the final name through the parent FD (`mkdirat`, `linkat`, `renameat`, `unlinkat`, `rmdirat`). Component identity and symlink rejection are atomic at open time, so there is no lstat→open TOCTOU window. A symlink as a *parent* component is rejected (`SYMLINK_NOT_ALLOWED`) including links pointing inside the same workdir; a symlink as the *final* component is reported by `stat_file` as `type: "symlink"` (target never revealed), rejected by `read_text_file`/`list_directory`, and never followed or replaced by a mutation. rg runs rooted at a pre-validated directory FD (`/proc/self/fd`) with symlink following never enabled. |
| Special files | FIFOs, sockets and device files appear in `list_directory`/`stat_file` as `type: "other"` but are rejected before any content read (`UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE`) — reads can never block. `delete_file` accepts regular files only: a FIFO or socket yields `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE`, a directory `NOT_A_FILE`. |
| Hidden files | Dot-prefixed path components are denied everywhere (list/find/search/read/stat/resource/create/edit/delete/mkdir/rmdir), not just hidden from listings. With `SERVERFS_ALLOW_HIDDEN=true` they become visible and mutable on *every* channel, still subject to the deny rules. |
| Credential deny rules | `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.gnupg/`, `.kube/` are denied on every channel — reads *and* mutations, so a would-be path (`create_text_file(".env")`) is refused before anything is created. Append your own patterns via `SERVERFS_EXTRA_DENY_GLOBS` (e.g. `*.sqlite,internal/**`); those apply unconditionally. The built-in set can be released with `SERVERFS_DISABLE_DEFAULT_DENY=true` — see the warning below. |
| Read limits | `SERVERFS_MAX_READ_LINES` (500) and `SERVERFS_MAX_READ_BYTES` (512 KiB); a single line over the byte budget returns `LINE_TOO_LARGE` rather than a truncated line. |
| Write limits | `SERVERFS_MAX_WRITE_BYTES` (1 MiB) bounds `create_text_file` content, an edited source file, an edit result and the combined size of one call's `old_text`+`new_text`. `SERVERFS_MAX_EDITS_PER_CALL` (50) bounds one call's edit list. Content containing NUL yields `BINARY_CONTENT_NOT_ALLOWED`; binary *files* cannot be edited (`BINARY_FILE`) but can be deleted. |
| Search limits | rg subprocess with argument-array invocation (no shell, no string concatenation), streamed `--json` output, wall-clock 15 s deadline (terminate → grace → kill, no orphan processes), 50 MiB per-file ceiling, and a true *global* result limit: rg is terminated as soon as `limit + 1` policy-valid matches exist, instead of scanning the whole tree. Result paths are re-checked against hidden/deny policy. |
| Audit log | Every tool call emits a structured `tool_call` event (tool, workdir, relative path, duration, success, `error_code`, plus per-tool counts and the new revision). File contents, `old_text`/`new_text`, search queries and host/container paths are never logged. The `startup` event records the effective security mode (`allow_hidden`, `default_deny_enabled`, `extra_deny_rule_count`, `read_write_workdirs`). |
| Docker | Read-only bind mounts by default (`create_host_path: false`), read-only container root filesystem, tmpfs `/tmp`, non-root UID 10001, `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`. `/workdirs/XX` becomes writable only when `WORKDIR_XX_READ_ONLY=false`; `/app`, the Python package and every system directory stay unwritable either way. |
| Network | The MCP container remains on `internal: true` networks only — no Internet egress and no published ports. The tunnel has its own egress network. v0.5.0's optional file-ingress sidecar has a separate egress network but no workdir mounts or OpenAI credentials; MCP can reach it only over a dedicated internal network, and the tunnel is not attached to that network. The sidecar accepts HTTPS/443 only, requires either exact allowlisted hosts or the explicit constrained OpenAI Azure-Blob account family (`oaisdmntpr` prefix, Azure account-name length/charset, fixed `.blob.core.windows.net` suffix), rejects non-global DNS answers, pins connections to validated IPs while verifying the original TLS hostname, and revalidates every redirect. Generic host wildcards remain unsupported. Streamable HTTP DNS-rebinding protection introduced in v0.4.0 remains unchanged in v0.5.0: only `serverfs-mcp:8000` is accepted and no non-empty Origin is allowed. |
| Secrets | `CONTROL_PLANE_*` never enters the MCP container (verified with `docker compose exec serverfs-mcp env`). |

File contents are treated as **untrusted data** — ServerFS only returns them as text and never acts on anything inside them.

Error messages are short, agent-recoverable codes (`PATH_NOT_FOUND`, `SYMLINK_NOT_ALLOWED`, …) and never contain internal container paths or host paths.

> **Warning — `SERVERFS_DISABLE_DEFAULT_DENY=true`**: this releases only the *built-in* credential rules (`.env`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`, `.ssh/**`, …), letting the agent read **and modify** credential material inside your workdirs. `SERVERFS_EXTRA_DENY_GLOBS` still applies and is the intended place for compensating rules. Hidden-path filtering (`SERVERFS_ALLOW_HIDDEN`) is a separate, independent switch. Use this option only when a workdir legitimately contains files matching the built-in patterns and you have reviewed the exposure.

### Concurrent writes: what ServerFS does and does not guarantee

ServerFS serializes mutations *within its own process* and re-checks the revision immediately before committing, so two agents cannot both apply an edit to the same revision. It does **not** provide linearizable transactions against writers it does not control: a host user, an IDE or another container can still rename a pathname in the window between the final check and the `renameat(2)`. Treat a read-write workdir as shared, and prefer pointing it at scratch space rather than at a directory a human edits at the same time.

## Tools

Read tools (work in every workdir):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_workdirs` | Discover configured workdirs, including each one's `access` (`read-only` / `read-write`) |
| `list_directory` | Sorted directory listing with offset/limit pagination |
| `find_files` | Recursive filename glob search; `truncated=true` whenever the scan stopped early at the match limit or the walk-entry cap |
| `search_text` | Literal (non-regex) content search via ripgrep, global streamed result limit with early-stop |
| `read_text_file` | UTF-8 reading with line pagination, byte caps and a `revision` for later edits |
| `stat_file` | type (`file`/`directory`/`symlink`/`other`) / size / mtime (RFC 3339 UTC) / best-effort MIME / `revision` |

Optional binary tools (registered only when at least one workdir enables binary transfer):

| Tool | Contract |
|---|---|
| `download_binary_file` | Return exact raw bytes as an MCP `BlobResourceContents`, plus size / MIME / SHA-256 / revision metadata. Enforces the effective binary size limit and rejects files that change during the read. |
| `upload_binary_file` | Whole-file upload from exactly one source: strict RFC 4648 `data_base64`, or (when optional file ingress is enabled) a ChatGPT/OpenAI `file` parameter. Default `overwrite=false` creates only. `overwrite=true` requires `expected_revision`, replaces one existing regular file atomically, preserves metadata, and rejects stale revisions or multi-hardlink targets. |

Mutation tools (read-write workdirs only; all require the path's parent to exist):

| Tool | Contract |
|---|---|
| `create_text_file` | Create a **new** UTF-8 text file. Any existing object at the path → `PATH_ALREADY_EXISTS`. Never overwrites. Atomic. |
| `edit_text_file` | Exact-match replacement in an **existing** UTF-8 text file, guarded by `expected_revision`. Never creates. All-or-nothing across the call's edits. |
| `delete_file` | Delete one regular file (binary included), guarded by `expected_revision`. Permanent. |
| `create_directory` | Create **one** directory; the parent must exist (no `mkdir -p`). `PATH_ALREADY_EXISTS` if anything is already there. |
| `delete_directory` | Delete **one empty** directory, guarded by `expected_revision`. Never recursive. |

A `serverfs://{workdir}/{path}` resource template is also exposed; it goes through the exact same validation as `read_text_file` and is **read-only** — mutations are available as tools only. Resources are all-or-nothing: a file that exceeds the read budget returns `RESOURCE_TOO_LARGE` instead of a silently truncated body — use `read_text_file` for paginated access.

Common error codes: `WORKDIR_READ_ONLY`, `BINARY_TRANSFER_DISABLED`, `BINARY_FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `BINARY_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `BINARY_SOURCE_REQUIRED`, `BINARY_SOURCE_CONFLICT`, `INVALID_BASE64`, `FILE_INGRESS_DISABLED`, `FILE_INGRESS_UNAVAILABLE`, `FILE_INGRESS_FAILED`, `FILE_INGRESS_URL_NOT_ALLOWED`, `FILE_INGRESS_HOST_NOT_ALLOWED`, `FILE_INGRESS_ADDRESS_NOT_ALLOWED`, `FILE_INGRESS_DNS_FAILED`, `FILE_INGRESS_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`, `FILE_INGRESS_UPSTREAM_FAILED`, `PATH_ALREADY_EXISTS`, `PARENT_NOT_FOUND`, `ROOT_MUTATION_NOT_ALLOWED`, `REVISION_REQUIRED`, `REVISION_CONFLICT`, `EDIT_CONFLICT`, `TOO_MANY_EDITS`, `WRITE_TOO_LARGE`, `BINARY_CONTENT_NOT_ALLOWED`, `BINARY_FILE`, `DIRECTORY_NOT_EMPTY`, `MULTIPLE_HARDLINKS_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `METADATA_PRESERVATION_FAILED`, `RESERVED_PATH`, plus the read-channel codes (`PATH_NOT_FOUND`, `SYMLINK_NOT_ALLOWED`, `DENIED_PATH`, `HIDDEN_PATH_NOT_ALLOWED`, `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE`, …).

## Operations

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```

## Upgrade

Two distinct paths — do not mix them.

Upgrading a **deployed instance** uses the published image: edit `SERVERFS_IMAGE`, then preserve the same deployment surface when recreating services.

Base filesystem-only / binary deployment:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose restart openai-tunnel
```

Agent-enabled deployment — **always keep the Agent overlay**:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.agent.yml pull
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.agent.yml up -d
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.agent.yml restart openai-tunnel
```

If v0.5.0 ChatGPT file ingress is also enabled, add `--profile file-ingress` to the same Compose invocation; do not replace the Agent overlay with the profile. Recreating `serverfs-mcp` with only the base file removes the Agent socket/lock mounts and makes the runtime surface Agent-disabled even when the `.env` still contains valid Agent policy.

Building the **source** yourself (dependency pins, local changes) uses a scratch tag, so a pinned release tag is never repointed at local code:

```bash
SERVERFS_IMAGE=serverfs-mcp:dev docker compose build
SERVERFS_IMAGE=serverfs-mcp:dev docker compose up -d
```

Dependency versions are pinned: `mcp==2.2.0` in `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`, the builder image `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.12.15` in the `Dockerfile`, and the tunnel image `ghcr.io/openai/tunnel-client:v0.0.14` in `.env.example`. Upgrade deliberately by changing those pins and rebuilding along the source path. Avoid `latest`.

For **production**, pin `SERVERFS_IMAGE` to an exact published release instead of `latest`. After v0.7.0 is published, use:

```env
SERVERFS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ntlx/serverfs_mcp:0.7.0
```

Pinned deploys are reproducible, upgrades are explicit, and rollback is a one-line change back to the previous version. `latest` is convenient for a first look, not for a long-lived deployment.

### Upgrading to v0.7.0

v0.7.0 is an additive Agent-runtime reliability release. The Bridge migrates existing SQLite state in place, preserving historical tasks without fabricating v0.7 manifest/deadline/correlation evidence. Existing inline results and Agent task semantics remain compatible, while the Agent MCP surface gains one read-only tool, `read_agent_task_result`, for exact chunked retrieval of spooled final responses.

Before updating the host Bridge, confirm there are no active writer-lease tasks and use the existing user-scoped installer/update flow. After the update, a stale persistent recovery guard deliberately blocks file mutations with `WORKDIR_RECOVERY_REQUIRED` until startup reconciliation can prove the prior provider is no longer active; ServerFS never blindly reruns an interrupted task. Jev remains optional, fail-open and advisory-only exactly as in v0.6.0.

After v0.7.0 is published, production container deployments should pin `SERVERFS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ntlx/serverfs_mcp:0.7.0`. Agent-enabled clients must refresh their MCP tool schema to see `read_agent_task_result`.

### Upgrading to v0.5.0

The v0.5.0 upgrade is backward-compatible by default: `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ENABLED=false`, `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ALLOW_OPENAI_BLOB_HOSTS=false`, the ingress sidecar is not started unless the `file-ingress` profile is selected, and existing Base64 binary transfer continues to work. For current ChatGPT fileParams, set both booleans to `true` and add `--profile file-ingress` to the same Compose command you already use. Exact additional hosts can still be supplied through `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS`; generic wildcards are rejected.

Rollback is equally narrow: set `SERVERFS_FILE_INGRESS_ENABLED=false`, stop/remove the optional `serverfs-file-ingress` profile service if it was running, pin `SERVERFS_IMAGE` back to the previous release, then `pull` + `up -d` using the same base/Agent overlay shape as before and restart `openai-tunnel`. No workdir data migration is involved.

### Upgrading from v0.1

Nothing to do beyond bumping `SERVERFS_IMAGE`: the new tool surface is additive, every existing workdir stays read-only (no `WORKDIR_XX_READ_ONLY` in a v0.1 `.env` means `true`), and the deny/hidden policy is unchanged. Preserve the deployment surface shown above when recreating the container.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --frozen
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pytest
docker compose config
SERVERFS_IMAGE=serverfs-mcp:dev docker compose build
```

The scratch tag on the last line matters: `image` doubles as the tag Compose builds to, so an untagged build with a pinned production `.env` present would repoint that release tag at your working tree.

## Still not in v0.7.0 (by design)

No generic URL downloader, no rename/move/copy, no recursive mkdir or delete, no in-place binary editing API, no chmod/chown tools, no symlink or hardlink creation, no chunked/resumable transfer sessions, no shell or command execution, no Git operations, no automatic backup or trash, no database/index/RAG, no ACL management, no cross-workdir move, no OAuth/SSO, no web UI, and no file watching. Binary transfer remains bounded whole-file transfer; the optional ChatGPT file-ingress sidecar is a narrow, policy-checked HTTPS ingress capability that accepts only exact administrator hosts or the explicit constrained OpenAI Blob family rather than acting as a general proxy.
